# Numerical Linear Algebra

Scilab implementations of numerical methods for solving problems related to Linear Algebra. Developed for the discipline Numerical Linear Algebra (FGV EMAp).

**Practice 1:** Gaussian Elimination

**Practice 2:** Jacobi & Gauss-Seidel Methods

**Practice 3:** Power Method & Displaced Power Method with Inverse Iteration

**Practice 4:** Least Squares Method

**Practice 5:** QR Decomposition (Gram-Schdmit, Householder and for Eigenvalues)

Each Practice contains a report (pt-BR) describing the implementations and testing processes of each method under certain circumnstances, evaluating their capabilities and limitations.
